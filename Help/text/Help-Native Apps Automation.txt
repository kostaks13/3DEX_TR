Represents the entire current application and its frame window.
TheApplication object is the root object for all the other objects you can use and access from scripts. It corresponds to both the application itself and to its frame window. It directly aggregates four collections:
1. The editor collection represented by theEditors collection object.This collection contains all the editors currently managed by the application. Use theEditors property to return the Editors collection object. 2. The printer collection represented by thePrinters collection object.This collection contains all the printers accessible from the application. Use thePrinters property to return the Printerscollection object. 3. The setting controller collection represented by theSettingControllers collection object.This collection contains a generic setting controller for each setting repository managed using an XML file, and some specific setting controllers. Use theSettingControllers property to return theSettingControllers collection object. 4. The window collection represented by the Windows collection object.This collection contains all the windows currently opened by the application, each window displaying objects managed by an editor. Use theWindows property to return the Windows collection object. 
In addition to these four collections, theApplication object also aggregates:
l AnEditor object: at any time, an Editor object among those managed by the application is active and associated with theobjects displayed in the active window, that is, the window the end-user is currently working in. This active editor gives access to the objects visible in the active window and to the set of operations that can be applied to those objects. This editor sets the available menus and toolbars that make it possible to edit the objects it controls, according to the root object type. Use the ActiveEditor property to return the active editor.
l A FileSystem object that enables you to manipulate folders and files. Use the FileSystem property to return the file system object 
l A Printer object: the active printer. Use the ActivePrinter property to return the active printer
l A Service object: object-independent session-levelService objects can be retrieved from theApplication object thanks to theGetSessionService method. A Service object has methods that can execute whatever the objects managed by the active editor. For example, creating and running a search in the database does not depend on the objects managed by the active editor in the active window. It ismade possible using a method of the session-levelSearchService object. 
l ASystemConfiguration object, providing access to system or configuration dependent resources, such as the operating system, the current version, release, and service pack, and the available licensed products. Use the SystemConfigurationproperty to return theSystemConfiguration object 
l ASystemService object, providing information about the system environment, and services to run a script or a process. For example, theEnviron method retrieves the value of a given environment variable. Note that the SystemServiceobject is not aService object, that is, is retrieved thanks to theSystemService property of the Application object, while a Service object is retrieved using theGetSessionService method. 
l A Window object: the active window. Use the ActiveWindow property to return the active window. 
l A Workbench object that you can retrieve thanks to its workbench identifier using theGetWorkbenchId method. 
TheApplication object has other properties, such asLocalCache to return the local cache path, andCacheSize to return the local cache size. As the application represents the frame window, you can retrieve or set the frame dimensions and location

Represents a service.
The Service object gives access to a set of object-independent operations, that either apply to the session and are editor and data independent, or globally apply to the objects controlled by the active editor and aggregated to the PLM root object. Because theService object is an abstract object, you can manipulate its derived objects only.
A session-level service includes operations that either apply to any PLM type root object, or without any PLM root object active. On the opposite, an editor-level service applies only to a dedicated PLM type root object.
l Session-level services:
¡TheMATPLMService object to create materials, set or retrieves core or covering materials, remove applied materials, and retrieves all materials in session.

Represents a setting controller.
TheSettingController object enables you to access the setting attributes stored in setting repository files, and arranged in the different property pages of the Options dialog box you can display thanks to theOptions command of the Tools menu. There are two kinds of setting controllers.
1. TheSettingRepository object is the generic setting controller. It applies to any setting repository having an XML definition. Refer to Setting Repository Reference to have the list of such setting repositories 2. Specific setting controllers, each dedicated to a given setting repository that is not described using an XML file. For example, theDynLicenseSettingAtt object deals with the dynamic licensing setting repository that stores the list of available configurations and products for which you can request a dynamic license. 
The generic setting controller and all of the specific ones share the five methods of theSettingController object to deal with the whole set, or a subset of the setting attributes of a setting repository:
l Commit to make a memory copy of the setting attribute values 
l Rollback to restore the last memory copy of the setting attribute values
l ResetToAdminValues to restore the administered values of all the attributes 
l ResetToAdminValuesByName to restore the administered values of a subset of the attributes
l SaveRepository to make a persistent copy of the setting attribute values in a file. 
Retrieving the Generic Setting Controller
The generic setting controller can be retrieved for any of the setting repositories listed in Setting Repository Reference,provided the configuration or product it belongs to is installed on your computer. Use the SettingControllers property of theApplication object to return theSettingControllers collection. Then use itsItem method to return the generic setting controller applying to the GeneralGeneral setting repository.
Dim cSettingCtrls As SettingControllersSet cSettingCtrls = CATIA.SettingControllersDim oSettingCtrl As SettingRepositorySet oSettingCtrl = cSettingCtrls.Item("GeneralGeneral")
Using the Generic Setting Controller
Use the GetAttr orPutAttr methods of the SettingRepository object to return or set the value of an attribute. The example below returns the value of the DragAndDrop attribute of the GeneralGeneral setting repository, and if this value is returned true, set it to false. 
Dim oDragAndDrop As BooleanoDragAndDrop = oSettingCtrl.GetAttr("DragAndDrop")If oDragAndDrop Then  oSettingCtrl.PutAttr "DragAndDrop", FalseEnd If
Retrieving a Specific Setting Controller
Use the SettingControllers property of theApplication object to return theSettingControllers collection. Then use itsItemmethod with the appropriate identifier to return the specific DynLicenseSettingAtt object.
Dim oSettingCtrls As SettingControllersSet oSettingCtrls = CATIA.SettingControllersDim oSettingCtrl As DLNameSettingAttSet oSettingCtrl = oSettingCtrls.Item("CATSysDynLicenseSettingCtrl")
The names to pass to the Item method are:
Using a Specific Setting Controller
A specific setting controller manages the setting attributes located in a setting repository. A property and two methods enable you to manipulate each setting attribute:

1. A read-write property to return or set the setting attribute value 2. A method to retrieve information about the setting attribute:
¡The level of administration of the setting attribute 
¡The lock status of the setting attribute (Locked or Unlocked) 3. A method to set a lock onto the setting attribute 
Depending on each setting attribute, when a property is not suitable, the read-write property can be replaced with a couple of methods. For example, a setting attribute managing a color must return or set three integer values. This cannot be performed by a property, and a method with three parameters must be used instead.
Refer to each derived specificSettingController object to know the setting attributes it manages and how to manipulate them.
Represents a viewer.
A viewer is used to display a objects according to a given viewpoint and display options. Depending on the PLM type of the root object, the following viewers can be found in a window:
l 3D Shape Representation: a Viewer3D object for the part 3D objects and/or a SpecsViewer object for the part specification tree 
l Product: a Viewer3D object for the assembly 3D objects and/or a SpecsViewer object for the assembly specification tree 
l Drawing Representation: aViewer2D object for the drawing sheets and/or aSpecsViewer object for the drawing specification tree.
When the window displays both a Viewer3D object and a SpecsViewer object, or one or severalViewer2D objects and a SpecsViewer object , it is a SpecsAndGeomWindow object. You can activate a given viewer in a multi-viewer window, fit all the scene in the viewer, update the display, zoom in and out, and capture the contents of the viewer as an image file.
Display options depend on the viewer type. All viewers share display options such as the background color and the display on the whole screen or in a smaller window. In addition, Viewer3D objects allow for different lighting modes and for modifying lighting intensity, and for depth effects, navigation styles, rendering modes, and clipping modes.
Represents a 3D viewpoint.
AViewpoint3D object is aggregated to theViewer3D object. It holds data to define how objects are seen to enable their display by a 3D viewer:
l The eye location, also named the origin of the scene to display, expressed in model units 
l The distance from the eye location to the target, that is, to the looked at point in the scene. 
l The sight, up, and right directions, defining a 3D coordinate system with the eye location as origin. 
l The projection type: perspective (conic) or parallel (cylindrical). 
l The zoom factor to apply for display.

The 3D viewpoint is the object that stores data which defines how your objects are seen to enable their display by a 3D viewer. This data includes namely the eye location, also named the origin, the distance from the eye to the target, that is to the looked at point in the scene, the sight, up, and right directions, defining a 3D axis system with the eye location as origin, the projection type chosen among perspective (conic) and parallel (cylindrical), and the zoom factor. The right direction is not exposed in aproperty, and is automatically computed from the sight and up directions.
Represents a service for visualization purposes.
The VisuServices object lets you manage:
l The Cameras collection object. 
l The layers and the layer filters. 
l The hidden elements visibility. 
l A new window for the data displayed in the active one.

A collection of Window objects that represent of all the windows currently managed by the application.
The Windows collection object gathersWindow objects which make the link with the windowing system and display objects in a viewable form, mainly in 3D or 2D modes, or as a specification tree in graph or tree mode. Windows of the collection can be arranged in the frame.
Retrieving the Windows Collection
Use theWindows property of the Application object to return the Windows collection object.
Dim cWindows As Windows Set cWindows = CATIA.Windows
Using the Windows Collection
Use the Item method to return a window from the Windows collection object, namely below the third one.
Dim oWindow As WindowsSet oWindow = CATIA.Windows.Item(3)
Note that you can also use the window name in place of the window range. The example below returns the search window the name of which is "Name Like Part".
Dim oWindow As WindowsSet oWindow = CATIA.Windows.Item("Name Like Part")
Use the Arrange method to arrange the windows. You can arrange the windows, according to the values of the CatArrangeStyle enumeration:
l As horizontal tiles.
l As vertical tiles. 
l As a cascade. 
CATIA.Windows.Arrange(catArrangeCascade)
Represents a window.
AWindow object aggregates a Viewers collection object that enables the window to display the application data in theappropriate modes using viewers. A SpecsAndGeomWindow object features altogether a 2D or a 3D viewer and a specification tree viewer. A window can be activated, that is becomes the active one, using theActivate method. This implies that the editor that controls the objects displayed in this window is also activated if it was not, and that subsequent interactions will affect it until another window is activated instead. The Viewers property returns the aggregatedViewers collection object, and theActiveViewer property returns the active viewer in the window.
