What Is New with 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Automation?
Automation reflects the changes brought to 3DEXPERIENCE platform compared to V5.
The main change in the data model consists in replacing the document-centric model relying on files with a product/representation model relying on a database and a client/server architecture. Main characteristics are:
lThere are no Part, Product, Drawing, Material, or Analysis documents and files any longer. They are replaced with product references and instances. 
lAll data models are specializations of the same PLM Core model that enables an non-semantic server-layer code to perform robust query and save operations on stateless servers, removing data mapping problems and data loss. 
lThe Product model, as well as the other data models, is a unique entity-relation based model designed to reduce the storage size in the database, to allow for large assemblies in sessions and for perfect symmetry without data loss when back and forth loading and storing data. 
lParts support the multi-representation thanks to isolation between the part reference and its shape. 
lEach PLM entity is assigned a unique identifier whatever its type supporting any PLM operations, such as versioning, configuration, or replication. 
Other changes are related to the user interface that offers the Bar and the Compass in addition to the 3D compass, for easy search, navigation, and real-time collaboration.
How to Adopt 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Automation?
Before modifying macros to take advantage of 3DEXPERIENCE platform architecture, a minimal understanding of PLM concepts, PLM objects customization and products is required and can be found in the product documentation. The following steps should then be considered:
1.Choose target languages for 3DEXPERIENCE platform macros. 2.Understand main modifications that will have to be performed. 3.Assess3DEXPERIENCE platform functional level to understand which macros will run on the current level. 4.Define the structure of libraries that will allow macro persistency, create any required library and macro, and initialize macros with V5 content. 5.Review all macros. Modify what is required and test code using the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of the Adoption section as a reference. 
Those steps are described below in more details.
Choose Target Language for 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Macros
Of course CATScript, VBScript and VBA are still supported.
Scripting languages supported in V5 are still supported: CATScript, Visual Basic for Application and Visual Basic Scripting Edition (VBScript) can be used, detailed levels are provided in the product Program Directory. 3DEXPERIENCE platform now integrates VSTA, meaning that C# and VB.NET are additional scripting languages to choose from. So it is possible either to keep the choices that were made in V5 or to take advantage of3DEXPERIENCE platform adoption to review those choices.
For example CATScript files content is dynamically preprocessed into VBScript before being executed. This runtime cost could be avoided by removing any typing information from the V5 CATScript macros and storing the result in a catvbs macro. Migrating macros to C# of VB.NET could also be considered in the perspective of complying to a development language corporate strategy.
Understand Main Modifications
This approach is based on main V5 scenarios commonly used when creating macros and aims to understand which are the main modifications that will be required. The articles provided inMain Applications Patterns part of the Adoption section should be read first, they address:
lAutomating Access to Settings.
lWorking with Objects. 
lBringing Objects into Session and Saving objects. 
lAccessing Objects in Session. 
lCreating Objects. 
lAccessing Objects Through Generic Methods. 
It is also recommended to read the article Product Changes in theDetails of modifications on V5 modelers part of the Adoption section.
Assess 3DEXPERIENCE Platform Functional Level
All V5 object and methods may not be available in the current3DEXPERIENCE platform level. As there is no explicit compilation of macro code for languages available in V5, this cannot be fully performed before the code modification phase but high level hints can be found:
lIn the Object Reference part of theReference section that lists available 3DEXPERIENCE platform objects 
lIn the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of the Adoption section that described for V5 modelers available in the current 3DEXPERIENCE platform level, which thinner level functionality may not be available. 
Define Macros Persistency
Macros are saved and accessed in macro libraries stored in the PLM server database. This allows easy access from any client seat to corporate macros. Macro libraries must so be created first, typically their number and names will reflect language used by stored macros and any kind of logical gathering (processes where they should be used, functional domains, etc.).
For each V5 macro that will be processed, a3DEXPERIENCE platform macro should be created in one of the libraries, and the code should copy/pasted from the V5 document they were saved in.
lCATScript and catvbs files can be edited using any text editor.
Overview of Adoption for AutomationTechnical Article
Abstract
This article explains how to transform your V5 Automation macros to take advantage of the3DEXPERIENCE platform.
This article describes or points to articles describing the main new concepts and technologies you need to understand before looking at your Automation macros. Then a change methodology is explained along with where to find the appropriate information.

lCATVBA files must be read first using a V5 session and should be exported as .bas files using the embedded VBA editor. This .bas file will then be imported using the VBA editor associated with a 3DEXPERIENCE platform session. 
lMacros stored in non macro-specific V5 documents like CATPart or CATDrawing files, cannot be saved in their hosting representations in 3DEXPERIENCE platform. You can: 
¡Store them in the database: import the V5 file. A dedicated representation is created to contain the macro. You can save this macro in a PLM macro librarycorresponding to the macro language (CATScript or VBScript). You can then recall the macro from its PLM macro library using the Macros dialog box ofthe Macro command in the Tools menu. Because the V5 automation model is not compliant with the 3DEXPERIENCE platform one, most of V5 macros cannot be used "As Is". To prevent problems, the FBDI process adds a string at the beginning of all imported macros to make them non-executable. Consult the article Macros File-based Design Import in the product documentation for more information. 
¡Store them in files: extract them from the V5 documents using a V5 session first, and save them as text in text files. The content of this text file can then be pasted in a3DEXPERIENCE platform macro edited in a3DEXPERIENCE platform session. V5 Documents do not need to be modified, the File Based Design Import mechanism (FBDI), that allows you to import V5 documents into the PLM server, will remove the macros code when the V5 document will be imported in the PLM server database.
Notes:
1.Documents that were dedicated to store macros in V5 (files with the .CATBVA, .CATScript or .catvbs extension) are not handled by FBDI. 2.Macro code stored in Knowledgeware features is kept when importing the document containing those features. A warning pop-up is however added. Consult the article Knowledgeware File-based Design Import in the product documentation for more information. 
Review, Modify, and Test Code
Once main modifications have been understood, persistency defined and 3DEXPERIENCE platform macro code initialized with V5 content, actual code modification and test can take place. Here again the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of the Adoption section should be used. It describes, for each V5 modeler available, which objects and methods have been changed and how.
Each macro should at least be reviewed and any usage of Documents collection, Document object or any object whose types derives from Document should be replaced. 
Note: A V5 macro should never be considered as acceptable for 3DEXPERIENCE platform if it has not at least been reviewed.
What Is Not Possible in Current Level?
Functionality involving links from representations to PLM object are not supported:
lCreation of contextual design. 
The way to access settings through Automation is simplified and can now be performed most of the time using the generic methods of theSettingRepository object relying on the XML-based description of the setting repositories and attributes.
V5 setting attributes are each managed using a dedicated read/write property and two dedicated methods: one for locking/unlocking the setting attribute, and one for retrieving information about it. For each setting attribute, in addition to its name and role, the tab page where it is accessed interactively, you then need to know or find its setting controller object and the way to retrieve it, and the property and method names to manage the setting attribute.
3DEXPERIENCE platform setting attributes are declared in XML files and managed using the set of six generic methods of the single SettingRepository object:
lGetAttr and PutAttr to retrieve and set the value of a simple type setting attribute.
lGetAttrArray and PutAttrArray to retrieve and set the value of an array type setting attribute. 
lGetAttrInfo to retrieve information about a setting attribute: is it administrated, locked, modified at the current administration level? 
lSetAttrLock to lock or unlock a setting attribute.
To access a 3DEXPERIENCE platform setting attribute, you just need to know its name and in which setting repository it is stored.
For example, the following pattern can be applied to retrieve a setting attribute value:
In this example, the V5 drag & drop ability setting attribute is managed by a specific property (DragDrop) of the specific setting controller object(GeneralSessionSettingAtt) managing the underlying setting repository. Another setting attribute is managed using a different property of possibly a different setting controller if the setting attribute belongs to a different setting repository. With 3DEXPERIENCE platform, the setting repositories are handled using a single object (SettingRepository), and the value of any setting attribute of a simple type, that is, that is not an array, is retrieved thanks to the GetAttr method.
For more information, consult the SettingController Object, that describes how to retrieve aSettingRepository object and details how to use it, and the Setting Repository Reference that describes and lists the setting repositories along with their setting attributes.
Note that the following V5 setting controller objects still exist in 3DEXPERIENCE platform. The associated setting repositories cannot thus be managed using the generic setting controller:

lDynLicenseSettingAtt

lMacrosSettingAtt
In addition, note that theFileAccessStatisticsSettingAtt object is removed in3DEXPERIENCE platform, since no files are used any longer.
The Parent Property
As in V5,3DEXPERIENCE platform object are aggregated by a parent object, itself being aggregated by its parent, this creating a tree whose root is theApplicationobject. The parent of an object can be obtained using its Parent property. Depending on the object, the behavior of the Parent property may have changed in3DEXPERIENCE platform. As a general rule:
lThe behavior of non persistent objects (windows, viewers, etc.) does not changed.
lObjects that persist inside 3DEXPERIENCE platform representation references like part or drawing data keep the same behavior, except when reaching the layer of PLM objects. For example:
lPLM entities, meaning objects that can be queried through PLM queries in3DEXPERIENCE platform, like the V5 Product object, are replaced, even if the concept is kept. The way they are aggregated, and so the behavior of the Parent property, may have changed. Consult the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of this Adoption section for more information. 
The Name property
The Name property allows you to identify objects, for example inside collections. Here again only the behavior of V5 objects that become 3DEXPERIENCE platformPLMEntity objects is changed, mainly becausePLMEntity objects are identified by a customizable set of PLM attribute values, called the PLM Identifier Set, and not anymore by a simple string. The most common usages of the Name property are described below.
Adding Attributes to an Object
Very often the name of a V5 document, for example, is made up of a concatenation of attributes, allowing you to classify and retrieve objects:
<part number>_<responsible>.CATPart
In3DEXPERIENCE platform those attributes are typical PLM attributes, defined on the PLM representation reference object.
One specific type of attribute implemented this way is the extension of the document: retrieving all Product documents in a folder in V5 is performed through a query on product objects in 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
Note: the Path property of the V5Document object is often used the same way. 
Displaying a User Understandable Name
For example, in a macro that performs checks on V5 documents, when a problem is discovered, the message must allow the end user to understand to which object it applies. In V5, the name of the document was the obvious information to provide. In3DEXPERIENCE platform this information could be part of, or the whole PLM Identifier Set and maybe specific attributes. In any case this heavily depends on the customization applied to PLM metadata, that itself aims to implement corporate processes.
The GetItem Function
The GetItem function allows you to retrieve an aggregated object from its name particularly when the aggregation is dynamic. For example, a Part object does notaggregate a Layout2DRoot object if the 2D Layout for 3D Design application was not used. Otherwise, theLayout2DRoot object is retrieved this way:

This article explains how to transform your V5 Automation macros to take advantage of the Open3DEXPERIENCE platform PLM infrastructure. It focuses on generic methods inherited by most objects from theAnyObject object or the Collection object:

V5 Automation' Accessing the 2D Layout rootDim o2DRoot As Layout2DRootSet o2DRoot = CATIA.ActiveDocument.Part.GetItem("CATLayout2DRoot")
As for the Parent property, this may have changed depending on the objects with which it was used when PLM objects are involved. Consult theDetails of modifications on V5 modelers part of this Adoption section for more information.
In V5 the Document object is the key object that allows persistency. Through the Documents collection objects, newDocument objects can be created as a repository for persistent data, modifications performed in session can be saved on disk, and existingDocument objects loaded data into session.
In3DEXPERIENCE platform persistent data is stored in the PLM server, either as a PLM object and its attributes and links or as the black box content of a specific PLM objects: the representation references.
This article explains how to bring objects into session, save objects, and related considerations. Creation of objects is described in the Creating Objects article.

--- PAGE 4 ---

Bringing Objects into Session
In V5, documents are stored on file systems and identified through a path. This path, including the document name, is often used to classify and add attributes on the document. TheOpen method of the Documents collection allows you to load a document in memory from its path. The content of the document can then be edited or browsed.
In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, the PLM server contains PLM entities that can be queried against a set of PLM attributes, using the SearchService service object. The result of a query is a set of PLM entities that must be opened using thePLMOpen method of the PLMOpenServiceobject before being browsed or edited through specific editors.
Note: depending on the query, the list of retrieved PLM entities may contain more than one object.
Saving Objects
In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, the save operation applies to all PLM objects opened in the active editor and is performed through the PLMPropagate method of thePLMPropagateService object.
Using the File Selection Box
TheFileSelectionBox property of the Application object allows to display a window where the path of a file can be selected. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, this can still be used to retrieve documents stored on a file system but PLM entities must be retrieved either through the SearchService service object, or using the interactive Search command.
Accessing the Document and the Editor
In V5 theDocument object gives access to persistent data loaded in session. This notion has been replaced in 3DEXPERIENCE platform by an Editor object. In the Model View Controller paradigm, the editor plays the Controller role. The editor federates all the objects that can be interactively edited in the same window. As for the V5Document object, the application object aggregates an activeEditor object and a collection of Editor objects. The following illustrates the modifications required to access a3DEXPERIENCE platform Editor object instead of a V5 Document object.
Accessing Objects Edited through the Document and the Editor
V5 Document objects are virtual objects that are specialized depending on their content, like for example thePartDocument or DrawingDocument objects. Most of the time a macro expects specific types of documents, the genericDocument object can so be replaced by a more specific object, like a DrawingDocument object, that provides dedicated methods to access its specific content. This is illustrated in the following macro that displays the number of sheets of a set of drawings.

For details on each type of V5 Document objects, consult the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of this Adoption section.
When V5 documents are already in session, the specialized type of the Document object allows to select a specific kind of document. Some objects may not be always present in the selected document. For example a PartDocument object will always contain aPart object but not always a Layout2DRoot object (2D Layout for 3D Design root object), so the type of theDocument object is not always discriminative. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, representation references may contain different types of data, so this last method is always required. The following example describes how to process all Layout2DRoot objects in session.
Changed Capabilities Related to Editing Objects in Session
Selection
TheSelection object aggregation is moved from the V5Document object to the 3DEXPERIENCE platformEditor object:
Cameras
V5 Camera objects are aggregated under the V5 Document object.3DEXPERIENCE platform Camera objects are only available in representations references in 3DEXPERIENCE platform and should be accessed through a service on the Editor object: the VisuServices object.
Commands and Workbenches
Some V5 interactive commands can be launched from a macro using the StartCommand method of the Application object. This capability still exists in3DEXPERIENCE platform but the name and behavior of the commands may have changed, so each usage of this method must be considered independently, based on 3DEXPERIENCE platform commands interactive behavior.
The same applies for interactive workbenches that can be accessed through the GetWorkbenchId and SetWorkbenchId methods of the Application object.
The GetWorkbench Method
TheGetWorkbench method of the Document object gives access, in V5, to a variety of objects, improperly called Workbench objects, that generally can't be seen as aggregated by another objects and offer access to edition contexts and creation or calculation services. Such V5 objects are not directly linked to the interactive notion of workbench described upper.
In 3DEXPERIENCE platform such objects will be retrieved as Service objects either available at session level or at editor level. The list of V5 objects accessible through theGetWorkbench method is not listed here. For details on availability and name of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform object equivalent to a V5Workbenchobject, consult the Details of modifications on V5 modelers part of this Adoption section dedicated to the corresponding V5 modeler.

In V5, the Document object is the key object that allows persistency. Through the Documents collection object, newDocument objects can be created as a repository for persistent data, modifications performed in session can be saved on disk, and existingDocument objects loaded into session.
In3DEXPERIENCE platform, persistent data is stored in the PLM server, either as a PLM object and its attributes and links, or as the streamed (black box) content of a specific PLM objects: the representation references.
This article focuses on object creation. Saving and retrieving objects is described in the Bringing Objects into Session And Saving Objects article. 
Creating Objects
For 3DEXPERIENCE platform object that are stored in reference representations. The creation mode has not changed, but PLM objects should be created using the PLMNewService object. This service should be used in three steps:
1.Creating a template entity that will receive any required PLM attributes and their default values. 2.Modifying the template entity PLM attributes values if necessary. 3.Creating and editing actual PLM entities in session using the template entity.
Note: Drawing representations are created with default values for standards and sheet style. See the Drafting Changes article for more information.
Creating Objects as Copy of Existing Objects
3DEXPERIENCE platform is no more document based, so the NewFrom method of the Documents collection object has no meaning anymore. No equivalent capability is currently provided.
In V5 a variety of objects could be seen as aggregated or not by a parent object depending on the products that were available in the installation, for example aStrWorkbench object could be obtained from aProductDocument object if a product featuring structure design capability was installed and a SPAWorkbench object could be obtained if a product featuring space analysis capability was installed.
Some of those objects were retrieved using two generic methods that have disappeared in 3DEXPERIENCE platform, the GetWorkbench method of the Documentobject and the GetTechnologicalObject method of the Product object, and a text string that described what object was to be retrieved. For example, the StrWorkbench object was retrieved the following way:
The generic GetItem method of the AnyObject object still exists in 3DEXPERIENCE platform but may not allow anymore to retrieve all objects that were available in V5.
How to retrieve objects currently available in 3DEXPERIENCE platform is described in the 3DEXPERIENCE platform Adoption documents related to each object. This purpose of this article is to provide a way to retrieve the same information starting from the V5 generic method for the most common objects.

The ProductDocument Object
In V5, the repository for Product objects and composition of Product objects is the product document. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, this information is stored in the PLM server. Products are PLM objects that must be retrieved and brought in memory through by Search, Explore and Open operations like described in Bringing Objects into Session And Saving Objects.

To access product objects in memory, a specific service has been provided on the Editor object: the PLMProductService service object. Here is a typical example of how to retrieve the root product of a product structure.
The Product Object and the Products Collection
Instance and References
The V5 Product object, that represents both concepts of instance and reference of a product, is split in3DEXPERIENCE platform into a VPMReference object, retrieved in the previous sample, and a VPMInstance object. The collection of Product objects that allowed to retrieved the instances aggregated by a product reference is so replaced in3DEXPERIENCE platform by a collection ofVPMInstance objects that contains the position information and points on its reference:
ThePosition object allows you to retrieve and modify the position of the instance.
Representations
As the V5 Product object, the 3DEXPERIENCE platform VPMReference object has representations that are instances of representation object, represented by the VPMRepInstance andVPMRepReference objects.
User Properties
Properties that can be associated to a V5 Product reference are in 3DEXPERIENCE platform attributes of thePLMEntity objects, parent class of all PLM objects. In V5 properties can be dynamically added to any reference while in3DEXPERIENCE platform  attributes must be declared, for a specific type of product, during the customization stage of the installation of the PLM server.  Their values can then be accessed or modified:
Publications and Connection
' A Product document is known by its pathsIdentifier="E:/myDocument.CATProduct"
' Its content is loaded through the Documents collection
Set oProductDocument = CATIA.Documents.Open("sIdentifier')

Access to Knowledgeware Parameters and Relations
In V5 theProduct object offers two collections to access parameters and relations. In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, theKnowledgeServices service object should be retrieved from theEditor object.
The GetTechnologicalObject Method
The V5 GetTechnologicalObject method provides access to a variety of objects linked to a product. For details on availability and name of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform object equivalent to such a V5 object, consult either the Accessing Objects Through Generic Methods article or the Details of modifications on V5 modelerspart of this Adoption section dedicated to the V5 modeler corresponding to the object.

This object is exposed in V5, but without any implementation. So it cannot be used in V5, should not be found in V5 macros, and is removed in 3DEXPERIENCEplatform.
lThe Loop object 
As a specialization of the KnowledgeActivateObject object, it does not provide any properties or methods in V5. If you used it in V5, you can replace it with this object. 
The setting objects are replaced with the generic one and XML files. Refer to KnowledgeInterfaces changed objects for details, and to Automating Settings to know how to use the generic setting object.

The PartDocument Object
The PartDocument object is in V5 the key object to access Part objects. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, those objects persist in the 3DShape representation of the Product modeler. In the following example, such a representation, whose type always derives from VPMRepReference, is retrieved through a set of attributes. Any kind of representation can be retrieved this way. No predefined attribute shows that the retrieved object is actually a 3DShape. Generally, company processes allow to identify 3DShapes by defining standard values for specific attributes. Content can also be tested using the GetItem method of the retrievedPLMEntity object.

The Product property of the PartDocument Object
In V5, a Product object is contained in each Part document. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, this is not true anymore. V5 scenarios retrieving the Product object contained in the Part Document generally aimed at identifying which product is a Part when exploring a product structure, to process data inside the Part document:
Note that in V5, references and instances have the same Product type, while in3DEXPERIENCE platform, they have distinct types: VPMReference and VPMInstance.
Objects Related to Part Applications
Retrieving a Part object is described above. Objects that are retrieved from the Part object in V5, likeSketch objects, Shape objects,Body objects, HybridShapeobjects, orLayout2DRoot objects are retrieved the same way in3DEXPERIENCE platform:

In V5, Drawing documents are created through the collection of documents. In3DEXPERIENCE platform, a PLMNewService object should be used as explained in the Creating Objects article. For drawing representations, the standard and Sheet style are set with a default value when creating the representation, and if required can be re-set after creation:
Setting the Drawing Standard
In V5, the drawing standard is represented by values of an enum, allowing to set only a predefined set of standards. In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, corporate standardscan be defined and the VB APIs allows to reference such standards by name. The type of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform Standard property is so now a string and the DrawingService service allows you to get the list of available standards.
Setting the Drawing Sheet Style
In V5, a sheet style can be set using interactive commands but Automation only allows you to set values of each part of the style individually. In 3DEXPERIENCEplatform, it is still possible to individually set each part of a sheet style, like the paper orientation,  but it is also possible to globally set predefined or customer defined styles associated with a standard.
Creating Interactive Views
New objects and methods to create interactive views are proposed to replace no more accessible methods of the GenerativeViewBehavior object.

Creating a Projection View
The same way, theAddProjectionView method of the DrawingViews collection object should be used.
Creating an Isometric View
The same way, theAddIsometricView method of the DrawingViews collection object should be used.
Accessing the View Projection Plane
In V5, methods of the GenerativeViewBehavior object allow you to retrieve or set the view projection plane. In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, they are available with the DrawingView object.
In V5, methods of the GenerativeViewLinks object allow you to add a link or to retrieve the 3D link from the Generative View. In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, they are available with the DrawingGenView object.
So, both methods to retrieve GenerativeViewLinks (get_GenerativeLinks) or GenerativeViewBehavior (get_GenerativeBehavior) from theDrawingView are useless.
Creating, Managing and Modifying a Generative View
In V5 generative views are accessed through theGenerativeViewBehavior object. In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, this object is replaced with several objects. The different usage scenarios are described below.
Creating Generative Views
TheDrawingDefineGenView object contains all methods to create generative views. It can be retrieved from the 3DEXPERIENCE platform DrawingDefineGenViewproperty of theDrawingViews object. The following examples show the creation of a generative view in V5 and in 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
Managing Generative View Properties
TheDrawingGenViewPropertiesobject should be used. It can be retrieved from the 3DEXPERIENCE platformDrawingGenViewProp property if the DrawingService object. Default values are initialized from generative view settings.
Modifying the Generative View
TheDrawingGenViewobject should be used. This object proposes methods to add a breakout, create a break view, etc. It can be retrieved from the 3DEXPERIENCE platformDrawingGenView property of the DrawingView object.
Example
The following example shows how to create a generative front view where hidden lines are drawn.
' from the DrawingView object' even if the View is not generativeDim oViewGenB As DrawingViewGenerativeBehaviorSet oViewGenB = oFrontView.GenerativeBehavior' View Anchor point
oFrontView.x = 10.oFrontView.y = 10.

Annotation Sets
In V5, 3D Functional Tolerancing & Annotations objects are obtained through the AnnotationSets collection object, retrieved:
lIn a CATPart document 
Directly under the Part object:
Set cAnnotationSets = oPart.AnnotationSets
lIn a CATProduct document: 
Through the GetTechnologicalObject method of a Product object:
Set cAnnotationSets = oProductDocument.Product.GetTechnologicalObject("CATAnnotationSets")
lIn a CATProcess document: 
Through the GetItem method of aProcessDocument object:
Set cAnnotationSets = oProcesstDocument.GetItem("CATAnnotationSets")
In3DEXPERIENCE platform, annotation Sets is only defined in a 3D Shape representation reference. The AnnotationSets collection object is retrieved by using the AnnotationSets property of thePart object.
Hereunder the script create a dimension of a hole. The surface of the hole is selected before launching the macro.
Below is the script to create anAnnotationSet object from the Part object.

Working with Sections
Part of the functionality accessible by the V5 Section object is available in the current release.Section objects were retrieved in V5: 
leither through the SPAWorkbench object that aggregated a collection of all section objects of the active document 
lor through theGetItem method applied to the root Product object of a Product document, that allowed to retrieve the same collection.
In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, theSectionService objects behaves like a collection and allows to retrieve any Section object visible in the editor on which theSectionService object has been requested.
On the Section object itself, the GetPosition and theSetPosition methods remain the same, theExport method now creates curve in a 3DShape representationidentified by its Part object, instead of aPartDocument object in V5, and the CutMode property has been renamed into a SceneRender property.
Working with Measures
The Measurable object allowed to analyze dimensions related to an objects or between two objects. AMeasurable object was obtained from an object throughGetMeasurable method of the SPAWorkbench object. Depending on the measured object, methods of theMeasurable object worked or not. For example theGetDirection method worked when the underlying object could be seen as a line and failed otherwise
In 3DEXPERIENCE platform, a Measurable object from a predefined type can be retrieved through the GetMeasurable method of theMeasurableService object. For example aMeasurableLine object has to be requested on an object in order to use the GetDirection method. If the underlying object cannot be seen as a line, the GetMeasurable method will fail.
TheGeometryName property allowed, by returning aCATMeasurableName enumerated value, to retrieved how to the underlying object was seen by the Measurable object:CatMeasurableLine for lines,CatMeasurablePlane for planes and so on.
In3DEXPERIENCE platform equivalent values have been provided as arguments of the GetMeasurable method:CAAMeasurableLine for lines,CAAMeasurablePlane for planes and so on. The measure type is so now requested by the programmer and not anymore deduced by the API, the property has so been removed. This has three consequences:
1.There is no equivalent to the CatMeasurableUnknown V5 value that was returned when underlying object was not measurable. If an object does not support the requested measure, the GetMeasurable method fails2.GetGeometryName cannot be used anymore in3DEXPERIENCE platform to determine how the object will be seen by the Measurable object. This is however still possible by requesting alternatively all possible measures on the object and processing failures3.Methods available in V5 on the Measurable object have been dispatched in3DEXPERIENCE platform in the different types of measurable objects. The names have sometimes been slightly changed to homogeneity purpose. 
The following array give a correspondence between the V5 methods of the Measurable object and the available 3DEXPERIENCE platform methods.
Use it with the AerospaceSheetmetalDesign setting repository. See the settings section in Automating Settings.

Working with Distances.
The V5 Distance object and its associated collection, allowed to calculate distances betweenProduct objects or groups of Product. Only the first one is available in 3DEXPERIENCE platform. It has been extended to any measurable object and has been provided thought a specific type of measurable: the MeasurableBetween object. 
The V5 Distances collection wat aggregated by the SPAWorkbench object. See upper how to retrieve a measurable object in 3DEXPERIENCE platform through the MeasurableService object.
The table below shows which V5 methods are supported in the current3DEXPERIENCE platform release.

V5 Business Process Knowledge Template is changed to Automated Design Process in3DEXPERIENCE platform. Since the objects handled are operations, the objects are renamed as follows:
TheBehavior objects are accessed in V5 from the object they extend using the BehaviorExtension object retrieved thanks to calling the GetItem method against this extended object. TheBehaviorExtension object aggregates a Behavior object that aggregates a Behaviors collection object where the Behavior objects associated to the extended object can be used.
This model changes with 3DEXPERIENCE platform. TheDPCOperations collection object can directly be retrieved from the extended object still thanks to the GetItem method. As a consequence: 
lThe Behavior object propertyBehaviors that returned the child Behaviors collection object is removed from the DPCOperation object.
lThe BehaviorExtension object is removed. It has one property and one method. Use the DPCOperations collection object to replace it, as follows: 
¡ExtensionClass propertyReplace a call to this property, such asoBehaviorExtension.ExtensionClass, with 
Dim cOperations As DPCOperations...Dim sExtension As StringSet sExtension = cOperations.Parent.Name
¡SelectBehavior methodReplace a call to this method, such asoBehaviorExtension.SelectBehavior("BehaviorName"), with 
Dim cOperations As DPCOperations...Dim oOperation As DPCOperationSet oOperation = cOperations.Operate("BehaviorName")
If the BehaviorExtension object is used in a script launched by a BehaviorVBScript operation object (behavior) to get the operation itself, use in 3DEXPERIENCE platform the first argument of the macro, which is the operation, as the argument of the Operate method.
Refer to DPCOperations Collection Object to retrieve such an object.
In addition:
lThe methods Activate andDeactivate of the Behavior object are removed. The best way to control the activity of an operation is to act on its "Activity" parameter. This can be done either through an EKL operation or through a VB launched by the VBScript Operation: 1.EKL: Compute the state of the targeted operation and directly valuate its "Activity" parameter. 2.VB: Compute the state of the targeted operation and valuate an output variable ("ActivateOrNot" for example) of the VBScript Operation. The "Activity" parameter of the targeted operation must be linked to "ActivateOrNot". 
lThe methods Start,Done, Suspend, and Cancel of theBehaviorVBScript object are removed from theDPCOperationVBScript object. They have empty implementations in V5, and can safely be removed from your macros in3DEXPERIENCE platform, if you still call them. 
In addition to object renaming and model changes, some properties or methods of theBehavior object are mapped to properties and methods of theDPCOperationVBScript object. Refer to CATBehaviorInterfaces changed objects for details.
